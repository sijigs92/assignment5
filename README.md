# Assignment5
Artificial Neural Network 
A machine learning framework called Neural Networks makes an effort to emulate the way that natural biological neural networks learn. Interconnected neurons with dendrites that accept inputs make up biological neural networks. These dendrites then use the inputs to generate an output signal that is sent to another neuron via an axon. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which we shall simply call neural networks, will be used to attempt to replicate this process. The simplest type of neural networks, a single perceptron, is the starting point for the process.

# Running the tests
Clone the repository using git clone "the web URL" which can be accessed by clicking the code dropdown button.
If Git is not installed on your system, the user can opt for the download zip option.
On the Jupyter Notebook opened in your browser, go to the cloned/downloaded folder and click the Assignment5.ipynb file.
Execute each block of code by pressing shift + enter or pressing the play button on the bar.
Brief Code Explanation
Installing
Install these required libraries using pip

Breakdown of Tests
Uses MLPClassifier with the following parameters:  hidden_layer_sizes=(5, 4, 5)  activation='relu' solver='adam' max_iter=10000 random_state=100 o Evaluates the model using a confusion matrix and classification report.

Decision Tree Classifier
